Well, I never have a clear plan. Perhaps this will just be a spontaneous let's play for the Python Challenge game, which taught me my beloved scripting language.
I dislike coding in the modern sense (copying, pasting, visual bla-bla, it is all a lie, you know.
To program, you must first know to model. The deeper you model, the finer your picture becomes about
the problem you are solving. And that might even not be a problem! Programming in the ~ way is fun,
challenge, game, mindbending trickery, magic, whatever, it is art, it is not work, but hell yeah,
sometimes it can become boring or hopeless. But since we live in an age of everybody wanting to earn
hard $$$s with coding and understanding shit about it... yelling at forums on each other for being clueless!
This game is a return to the classical, DIY machine-problem-solving.
You needn't use Python, but it is best fit for that.
